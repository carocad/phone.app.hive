  By using transact! all effectful functions can be made
  pure, thus easing testing significantly.

  Furthermore since they are independent of the context of their
  invocation, generative testing is even possible"

;; Before creating this mini-framework I tried re-frame and
;; Om.Next and I decided not to use either

;; re-frame has the problem that it uses an internal registry for
;; its event handlers. Since only a keyword is used to represent it
;; the user is left blind with respect to "what does this subscription returns?"
;; Furthermore since it is based on an eventful model, changing a little thing
;; in the state can lead to a cascade of changes, leaving the user wondering
;; "how did my app get into this state". There are plugins and devtools to figure
;; that out, but in my opinion fighting against the system is never a good idea.

;; Om.Next is a beast on its own. I think that the way that things are envision
;; is the right way to go for a long and big project. However Om.Next is too raw!!
;; It definitely doesnt feel natural to work with it. The user needs to define
;; a UI through `defui` but this itself is not the UI; you still need to use
;; om/factory to actually create something that you can use. Furthermore the
;; reconciler is a pain in the ass to work with. There is a million ways to
;; create, query and transact on your app state. Having to decide all that
;; up front is just too much!

;; Having said that, both frameworks have their strengths. Om.Next promotes
;; the "render a tree but think in graphs (app state)" mentality. I think that is
;; better than re-frame simple Clojure map. re-frame on the other hand uses
;; reagent to achieve automatic updates and hiccup ui declaration. That is
;; also great and it feels much more natural to work with. Also promoting
;; pure functions by returning data both in the subcriptions and in the
;; mutations is great.

;; rework tries to combine the strengths of both while mitigating its weaknesses
;; with an extra goal of trying not to reinvent the wheel. Therefore a couple
;; of decision are made up front for the user.
;; - the app state MUST be represented with a Datascript connection. This way
;; we can think in graph while re-using the code from Datascript. Pulling as in
;; Om.Next comes for free.
;; - the app must use reagent. As described in reagent.tx, we dont want to recreate
;; all the functionality that they have so reagent will serve us as rendering model
;; - the app should use Clojure's core.async to handle all asynchronous operations
;; - the app state can only be "changed" through the use of pure functions
