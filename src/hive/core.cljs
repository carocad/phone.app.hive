;; FOOD FOR THOUGHT
;; a possible way of synchronizing the entire datascript option would
;; be to create a serializer which takes the datascript content as datoms,
;; enumerates and stores them using the number as key and the datom as value.
;; This however would be very inneficient, therefore it would be best
;; to throtle it to say every 15 seconds or so.
;; Furthermore, storing the complete state again would be very inneficient
;; so a complete diff of the two states should be performed and only those
;; that changed should be stored.
;; Just to avoid mixing old datoms with recently removed datoms, a remove until
;; exception is found should be executed as well.
;; To restore the datoms, simply pass (range) and stop taking elements when a
;; read fails
;; Did I forget anything there?
;; PS: simply use add-watch to the datascript conn
