(ns hive.state.core
  "This namespace contains a mini framework which is just basically glue code
   between the different libraries used. Its main purpose is state management
   for Clojurescript Single Page Applications. Its secondary purposes are
   ease of use, no magic involved and testing support. Read below for more
   information on these

  This mini-framework simply uses the technologies out there to achieve its
  purpose, thus avoiding reinventing the wheel. A couple of decisions are made
  up front for the user.
  - the app state MUST be represented with a single Datascript connection. This
    way it is possible to represent the app state as a complex interconnected
    structure while being able to navigate it through its query/pull system
  - the app must use reagent. We dont want to recreate all the functionality
    that they have so reagent will serve us as rendering model and as reactive
    data framework

  Since the app is represented as a single Datascript atom. All state changes
  can be represented by Datascript transaction, which means that the functions
  that create those transactions can be pure, which will later on have an impact
  on testing.
  ;; example
  (state/transact [{:user/id :user/favorites data}]
  (state/transact (compute-favorites data))
  (state/trasact (async-chan-with-transaction))

  However no app can survive only with state changes. You always need to perform
  server synchronization, api calls, read/write from local storage, among others.
  Those *intended-effects* (as opposed to side-effects) are inevitable. This
  framework doesnt try to avoid them nor to mark them as evil, instead we understand
  that they are necessary. We encourage the logic of side effect to be encapsulated
  in frameworks intended for it, like Promises. However we prefer functions to
  *declare* their intended-effects instead of performing them.
  This is meant to ease testing. It is much more easy to test a function that returns
  a sequence of vector with values inside than it is to test a function which returns
  nothing but performs some effects inside.
  ;; example
  (state/transact [http/json url options])
  (state/transact (delay (hide-keyboard))"

;; Before creating this mini-framework I tried re-frame and
;; Om.Next and I decided not to use either

;; re-frame has the problem that it uses an internal registry for
;; its event handlers. Since only a keyword is used to represent it
;; the user is left blind with respect to "what does this subscription returns?"
;; Furthermore since it is based on an eventful model, changing a little thing
;; in the state can lead to a cascade of changes, leaving the user wondering
;; "how did my app get into this state". There are plugins and devtools to figure
;; that out, but in my opinion fighting against the system is never a good idea.

;; Om.Next is a beast on its own. I think that the way that things are envision
;; is the right way to go for a long and big project. However Om.Next is too raw!!
;; It definitely doesnt feel natural to work with it. The user needs to define
;; a UI through `defui` but this itself is not the UI; you still need to use
;; om/factory to actually create something that you can use. Furthermore the
;; reconciler is a pain in the ass to work with. There is a million ways to
;; create, query and transact on your app state. Having to decide all that
;; up front is just too much!

;; Having said that, both frameworks have their strengths. Om.Next promotes
;; the "render a tree but think in graphs (app state)" mentality. I think that is
;; better than re-frame simple Clojure map. re-frame on the other hand uses
;; reagent to achieve automatic updates and hiccup ui declaration. That is
;; also great and it feels much more natural to work with. Also promoting
;; pure functions by returning data both in the subcriptions and in the
;; mutations is great.
